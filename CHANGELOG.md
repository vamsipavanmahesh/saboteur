# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- An integration target can declare a known error profile
  (`allow_error_fraction` per strategy in integration/targets.yml): the
  majority-error exit is accepted only when the run's own fresh report
  carries the CLI's `errorMajority` marker, the errored fraction stays
  within the bound, and no mutant hit a resource limit. The JSON report
  records the run's exit cause under `saboteur.exitCause`.
- A survivor lists the first five tests that covered its line and still passed
  with the mutant applied, in the terminal and the HTML page.
- In diff mode (`--since`), each survivor names the changed line it relates to
  (`changed line: path:N` in the terminal, `changedLines` in each JSON finding),
  because a multi-line statement is reported at its first line.
- The score is split into assertion kills and crash kills, in the terminal,
  the JSON report (`saboteur.scores`) and the HTML page. A second score leaves
  out whole-body mutants (`body_nil`, `body_true`, `body_false`, `body_raise`). The headline score and
  `--threshold` are unchanged.
- `saboteur run --agent` (`--format agent`): one bounded JSON summary (under 8 KiB) on stdout
  with status, verdict, provenance, the first three findings and the commands for full
  detail. Exit 0 means a complete, clean run only: 1 survivors, 2 usage or config error,
  3 incomplete or failed. `--threshold` cannot be combined with it. The next commands are shell-escaped and keep the
  full selection; the working-tree state is read before the run; target output stays on stderr. `saboteur agent-skill`
  prints an AGENTS.md block for coding agents (also in `docs/agent-skill.md`). Classic
  exit codes are unchanged.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-11

### Added
- Fine `literal_boolean` and `literal_string` mutants: true/false swaps and
  nonempty static string replacement with `""`. Body-only traversal excludes
  arid/nested scopes, interpolation, heredocs and non-string text literals.
  New proposals can change scores and per-method-cap coverage.
- `saboteur run --id DIGEST`: replay one exact current mutant with selected tests,
  independent of caps, coarse gating, ignore suppression and incremental reuse.
  Prints the mutation diff and selected test ids for every replay result.
- Review findings in the JSON report (`saboteur.findings`,
  `Saboteur::Reporter::Findings`): a bounded, deterministically ordered list
  of survivors (coarse first, then file, line and digest) with the file,
  line, digest, subject, operator, original and replacement a note on a
  pull-request diff needs. Survivors accepted on the ignore list are listed
  separately with their reason; `survivorsTruncated` counts the rest, which
  stay in the full `files` data.
- Self-contained HTML report (`Saboteur::Reporter::Html`): one file with inline
  style and no script or network use, written to `.saboteur/report.html`.
  Change the path with `--html PATH` or `html_report:`. It shows the score,
  per-file mutants, survivors, warnings and skipped subjects.
- A GitHub Action (`uses: vamsipavanmahesh/saboteur`) that runs diff mode on pull
  requests. Advisory by default, with a job summary, outputs and a cached
  coverage map. See `docs/github-action.md`.
- Built-in `filter_replacement` mutants: `select` / `reject` and
  `select!` / `reject!`, for explicit-receiver calls with a block and no ordinary
  arguments. For unchanged subjects, existing mutants retain their digests and order.
  Runs may now include more mutants and report a different score.
- `saboteur doctor [--config PATH] [--seed N]`: environment checks and two fresh
  unchanged-suite checks, without mutation reports or coverage/verdict cache writes.
- `saboteur run SOURCE... --test TEST...`: mutate the named source files and
  run only the named spec files or directories. Positional sources replace
  `include` and `exclude`; `--test` replaces the spec paths in `rspec_args`.
- `--threshold PERCENT` (and `threshold:` in `.saboteur.yml`): exit 1 when the
  score is below PERCENT. The score decides the exit code instead of survivors.
  It fails closed: no score exits 1, and errored or resource-limited mutants
  exit 3.
- Positional sources must exist (exit 2 otherwise), and the selected tests are
  part of the coverage-map and `--incremental` cache keys.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- `--seed N` (and `seed:` in `.saboteur.yml`, default 1): every test run seeds
  Ruby's random numbers with it, so runs repeat; the report prints the seed.

### Fixed
- Linux: killed orphans adopted by the supervisor are reaped reliably, so no
  zombies are left behind (first run on Linux CI).
- The README status line describes what has actually been tested.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-10

First release that does mutation testing. MIT licensed.

### Added
- `saboteur run` with `--since`, `--subject`, `--timeout-factor`, `--jobs`,
  `--reeval`, `--json`, `--no-cache`, `--incremental`, `--config`.
- Subjects found with Prism; mutations are byte-range edits: whole-body
  `nil`/`true`/`false`/`raise` first, then comparison, boolean, arithmetic,
  numeric literal, statement removal, condition, negation, safe navigation
  and `||=`.
- Per-example test selection from a per-test coverage map, cached by content
  hash; timeouts scaled from each test's recorded duration.
- Verdict check: every kill is re-run on the unchanged method, so a test that
  fails anyway cannot count as a kill.
- Supervised children: whole process tree tracked and killed, deadline,
  memory and process caps, CPU-limit backstop, recursion guard.
- Parallel workers (`--jobs N`), including Rails apps on Postgres and SQLite
  with a database copy per worker.
- RSpec adapter and a Rails profile. Minitest is out of scope.
- Terminal report with unified diffs, Stryker JSON report, ignore list with
  mandatory reasons, incremental result cache.
- Mutation-source extension point and lifecycle hooks.

## [0.0.1] - unreleased

### Added
- Gem skeleton to reserve the name. No mutation testing yet.
